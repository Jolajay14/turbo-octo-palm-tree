I created a Database system for a library using SQL
The datbase contains information on their members, their library catalogue, loan history and overdue finerepayments.
I also created stored procedures and user-defined functions where aapplicable to enable them search the catalogue for titles of book, return a full list of all items currently on loan which have a due date of lessthan five days,insert a new member into the database and Update the details for an existing member.
I also created Views, triggers, and functions to present data in a more user-friendly format and make it easier to query the database.
