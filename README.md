I created a Database system for a library
The datbase contains information on their members, their library catalogue, loan history and overdue finerepayments.
I created stored procedures, user-defined functions, views, triggers, functions, roles and granted permissions where applicable to present data in a more user-friendly format and make it easier to query the database.
